# Business Problem

The primary objective of marketing agency is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for the clients' advertising campaigns. They have conducted two ad campaigns, one on Facebook and the other on AdWords, and as a data analyst you need to determine which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By identifying the most effective platform, the agency can allocate our resources more efficiently and optimize better advertising strategies to deliver better outcomes for the clients.

# Data Description
The dataset comprises a collection of data comparing the performance of two separate ad campaigns conducted throughout the year 2019. Specifically, the data covers a Facebook Ad campaign and an AdWords Ad campaign. For each day of the year 2019, there is a corresponding row in the dataset, resulting in a total of 365 lines of campaign data to analyze. The dataset includes various performance metrics for each ad campaign, providing insights into their effectiveness and efficiency over time.

Key features included in the dataset are as follows:

Date: The date corresponding to each row of campaign data, ranging from January 1st, 2019, to December 31st, 2019.
Ad Views: The number of times the ad was viewed.
Ad Clicks: The number of clicks received on the ad.
Ad Conversions: The number of conversions resulting from the ad.
Cost per Ad: The cost associated with running the Facebook ad campaign.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): The ratio of clicks to views, indicating the effectiveness of the ad in generating clicks.
Conversion Rate: The ratio of conversions to clicks, reflecting the effectiveness of the ad in driving desired actions.
Cost per Click (CPC): The average cost incurred per click on the ad.

Through thorough data analysis and visualization, this project aims to uncover actionable insights that can guide smarter marketing decisions and better customer targeting.
This project explores a key research question aimed at optimizing a marketing campaign by answering the below questions

### Platform Performance Comparison
    Which ad platform is more effective in terms of conversions, clicks, and overall cost-effectiveness?
### Perform EDA 
    How frequently do we observe days with high numbers of conversions compared to days with low numbers of conversions?
### Click-Through Impact
    Do more clicks on the ad really lead to more sales?
### Ad Forecasting
    What will happen when I do go with the Facebook Ad/Adwords ad? How many ad conversions can I expect given a certain number of ad clicks?
    Is there a long-term equilibrium relationship between advertising spend and conversion rates that suggests a stable, proportional impact of budget changes on 
    conversions over time?
### Cost Per Conversion Trends 
    How does the Cost Per Conversion (CPC) trend over time?
